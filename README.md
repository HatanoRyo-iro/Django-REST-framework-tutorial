# DjangoRESTframework　tutorial

**Awesome web-browsable Web APIs.**

Full documentation for the project is available at [https://www.django-rest-framework.org/][docs].

---

# Requirements

* Python 3.6+
* Django 4.2, 4.1, 4.0, 3.2, 3.1, 3.0

We **highly recommend** and only officially support the latest patch release of
each Python and Django series.

# Installation

Install using `pip`...

  pip install djangorestframework
  
Add `'rest_framework'` to your `INSTALLED_APPS` setting.
```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'rest_framework',
]
```

# Example

Let's take a look at a quick example of using REST framework to build a simple model-backed API for accessing users and groups.

Startup up a new project like so...

    pip install django
    pip install djangorestframework
    django-admin startproject example .
    ./manage.py migrate
    ./manage.py createsuperuser
    
# Execution method

 ./manage.py runserver

You can now open the API in your browser at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`, and view your new 'users' API. If you use the `Login` control in the top right corner you'll also be able to add, create and delete users from the system.
